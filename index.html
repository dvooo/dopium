<b>HEROIN</b><br>
I don't know just where I'm going<BR>
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can<BR>
'Cos it makes me feel like I'm a man<BR>
When I put a spike into my vein<BR>
And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same<BR>
When I'm rushing on my run<BR>
And I feel just like Jesus' son<BR>
And I guess that I just don't know<BR>
And I guess that I just don't know
</p><P>
I have made the big decision<BR>
I'm gonna try to nullify my life<BR>
'Cos when the blood begins to flow<BR>
When it shoots up the dropper's neck<BR>
When I'm closing in on death<BR>
And you can't help me now, you guys<BR>
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk<BR>
You can all go take a walk<BR>
And I guess that I just don't know<BR>
And I guess that I just don't know
</P><P>
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago<BR>
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas<BR>
On a great big clipper ship<BR>
Going from this land here to that<BR>
In a sailor's suit and cap<BR>
Away from the big city<BR>
Where a man can not be free<BR>
Of all of the evils of this town<BR>
And of himself, and those around<BR>
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know<BR>
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
</P><P>
Heroin, be the death of me<BR>
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life<BR>
Because a mainer to my vein<BR>
Leads to a center in my head<BR>
And then I'm better off and dead<BR>
Because when the smack begins to flow<BR>
I really don't care anymore<BR>
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town<BR>
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds<BR>
And everybody puttin' everybody else down<BR>
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
</P><P>
'Cos when the smack begins to flow<BR>
Then I really don't care anymore<BR>
Ah, when the heroin is in my blood<BR>
And that blood is in my head<BR>
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead<BR>
Then thank your God that I'm not aware<BR>
And thank God that I just don't care<BR>
And I guess I just don't know<BR>
And I guess I just don't know
</P>
